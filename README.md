## Build your own word database by using word frequency analysis
1. Delete `nya.pickle`
2. Copy a document to `nya`
3. Execute `nya.py`
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until you reach at least 10.000 unique words
5. Open `nyo.py`, configure the parameter (line 10 : maximum word length, or you can setup your own custom parameter), execute `nyo.py`, but make sure that you have at least 10.000 word entry.
6. Copy the list from `nyo.py` output to `index.html` line 132

The default word database is derived from Project Gutenberg's "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", and "Dracula", sorted by most frequent word.
